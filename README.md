## What is the 8-Queens Problem?

Place 8 queens on a standard 8×8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.  
This means no two queens can share the same **row, column, or diagonal**.

This project **visually demonstrates** how a **backtracking algorithm** finds a valid configuration.

---

## Features

- A clean, responsive UI styled with Tailwind CSS
- Step-by-step queen placement with **algorithm logs** and a live progress bar
- Custom fonts and aesthetic theme
- **Challenge mode** for users to manually solve the puzzle with safety highlights (shows red for unsafe moves)

---

## Modes

### Simulator Mode  
Watch the algorithm solve the puzzle with live commentary, logs, and visual feedback.

### Challenge Mode  
Try solving the 8-Queens problem yourself!  
Place queens manually — unsafe tiles glow red and only correct configurations are accepted.
